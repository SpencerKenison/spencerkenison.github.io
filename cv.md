## Experience

**Space Dynamics Laboratory** (Mechanical Engineering Assistant, 2024 – Present)  
At SDL, I work on space flight hardware and GSE: designing parts, running analyses, and helping them get built. Much of my time has gone into creating detailed GD&T drawings for components used in testing environments like thermal vacuum chambers, EMI, and vibration. I’ve run FEA to ensure our designs met modal and stress requirements, and follow the hardware all the way through machining and assembly daily, giving me understanding of the impact of design decisions.

**JR Automation – Setpoint Division** (Mechanical Engineering Intern, 2024)  
This internship introduced me to large-scale industrial automation design. I was part of a team building custom tooling and hardware for a multi-million dollar amusement ride retrofit. I worked on various jigs, updating drawings, and creating FAT/SAT/installation plans under a licensed engineer’s supervision. One of my more interesting projects was analyzing how an adhesive joint might fail under fatigue. Based on analysis, we determined a different fastening approach was needed.

**Black Box Engineering** (Mechanical Engineering Intern, 2024)  
My time at Black Box was quick and dirty. I joined mid-project during a retrofit of a fully automated line, helping hunt down hundreds of parts — both machined and off-the-shelf — while reverse engineering what was already on the floor. I created drawings for about 20 machined components including proper GD&T. It was a short internship I learned much about how a small team can operate well.

**Utah State University – College of Engineering** (Lead Mechanical Engineering Lab Technician, 2022 – 2024)  
As the lead student tech for the undergrad mechanical engineering labs, I kept everything running — including a wind tunnel, tensile tester, torque fatigue tester, and other experimental setups. I led a team of six students, and we worked hard to improve both the experience and the equipment. One of the most rewarding things I did was create a series of video tutorials and build a website to support lab courses.

**Autoliv** (Mechanical Engineering Intern, 2023)  
As my first internship, working at Autoliv gave me a close look at the high-volume, highs-standard manufacturing of airbags. I focused on production tooling design and drew up parts for both internal teams and external machine shops. I ran statistical tests on new friction weld studs, investigating possible cost savings in switching designs and suppliers. I worked with maintenance and QC teams, learning the role each team has.
